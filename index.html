        <h2>About Chandler Ames</h2>
        <p>My name is Chandler Ames. As a born and raised Pacific Northwesterner, I have grown to appreciate Washington state as my home. My personal and professional journeys have taken me to the southern states, Alaska, the West Coast states, Mexico, the Caribbean and Korea. As a vacationer, a military member, a journeyman, and blue-collar worker each doorway provided different rewards and obstacles to overcome. Throughout my life experiences, there were inherent qualities that continue to serve me well. I bring to the table the tenacity and fearless determination of a wrestler, the courage and loyalty of a soldier, the persistence and joy in gaming and coding, and the commitment of a husband, father, and family member. My next challenge is choosing a company that will use my newly acquired certification in coding and developing a mutually satisfying career in the tech field. I am eager to start and look forward to belonging and bringing something to a group, where the pride of ownership and contribution are valued.</p>
